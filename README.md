# Paraphrase-identification 
# Deep learning - PARAPHRASES IDENTIFICATION 
## Introduction
We present our deep learning project where the goal was to read and summarize the article : "Sentence Similarity Learning by Lexical Decomposition and Composition" in the first time. And secondly build a neural network capable of identifying if two sentences are paraphrases or not. During this project, we trained a ... 

## Prerequisites 
To be able to train the model you need to have python3 and the following packages installed : numpy, pickle, keras. You also need to :
